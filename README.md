## 🧭 Overview

This repository is my personal system configuration — built around:

- ⚡ **Hyprland** as the main window manager
- 🎨 Dynamic theming using **Matugen**
- 🖥️ Custom terminal environment (Kitty + Zsh)
- 🧩 Modular layout using **GNU Stow**
- 🔐 Hardened script permissions and layout for secure usage
- 🎯 Focus on both usability and scriptability
